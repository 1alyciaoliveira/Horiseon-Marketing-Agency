# Horiseon-Marketing-Agency

## Description

A code refactoring to make the webpage more accessible. This project is the challenge #1 of Tecnologico de Monterrey's bootcamp.

### What was done?

The HTML was built using semantic elements, following a structured logic order. CSS was also modified, shortening the code from 200 lines to 104.
The visual of the page matches, with a few changes in the position of online-reputation-management.jpg and the color of h1.
The title element was changed to make clear that this is a marketing agency website called Horiseon.
